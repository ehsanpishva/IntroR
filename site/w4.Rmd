In week 4, we will discuss how to work with R packages (we have already done so, but now want to discuss packages more formally) and cover some programming structures. In particular, the following topics will be covered:

- check what packages are installed
- how to install packages from CRAN
- difference between a package and a library
- CRAN task views
- updating packages
- searching for packages
- where / how to get help
- reproducible examples
- masking
- for-loops
- if-else statements
- generating random numbers

The R script for this tutorial:

- `intro_to_r_week_4.r`

The datasets for this tutorial:

- `data_survey_edit.rdata` (the dataset after the data preparation)
