### Excercise 3

These variables all use the  data frame ("data_survey_edit.rdata"). A data dictionary is provided to describe the variables in the dataset. 

Part A:

  - Test whether the perceived stress level differ between the primary sources of stress
  
  - Test if the impact of the stress sources on stress level is dependent on sex
  
  - Create a boxplot illustrating the comparison tested in Q3
	
<br>

Part B:

  - Test the association between the Pearlin Mastery Scale and the perceived stress level.
  
  - Adjust the association tested in Q1 for age and sex and education 
  
  - Plot the association betwee the two variables and fit the regression coefficient line
  
  - Use plot() for the result object obtained form the above association, place them in a 2x2 layout and try to interpret the generated plots
  
  - Test the correlation between sub-items of Pearlin Mastery Scale (mastery1, mastery2,...) and report the regression coefficients and p values
  
  - Create a scatterplot matrix of the sub-items tested in Q4
