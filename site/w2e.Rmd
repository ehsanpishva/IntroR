### Self-Study

For this week's self-study part, you will need these files:

- [data_survey_edit.rdata](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ti8z282h15dyutx/data_survey_edit.rdata?dl=1) (the dataset after the data preparation)
- [data_survey.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kbfisevspr0sk4m/data_survey.pdf?dl=1) (the corresponding code book)
- [intro_to_r_week_2_extra.r](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wfx0lgmhz0ofsya/intro_to_r_week_2_extra.r?dl=1) (the R script)

This self-study part covers the following topics:

- stratified summary statistics
- plot of group means
- boxplots for multiple groups
- stripcharts / dot plot
- violin/bean/beeswarm plots
- adjusting the axis values

### Exercise 2

In this exercise, we will continue to work with the dataset in `data_survey_edit.rdata`.

Part A:

  - Create a boxplot showing positive affect by marital status.

  - Modify the x-axis text.

  - Change the range of values in y axis.

  - Modify the labels for x and y axes.

  - Give different colors to each marital state.

  - Add jitter to the boxplot (https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/96-boxplot-with-jitter.html).

  - Add a legend and insert it at the top left (make sure it doesn't overlay your plots).

Part B:

  - Make a scatterplot showing the association between the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (total score) and negative affect.

  - Change the range of values in y axis.

  - Modify the labels for x and y axes.

  - Color label the points based on sex.

  - Use different symbols for male and female.

  - Add a correlation coefficient line to the scatter plot.

  - Add a legend and insert it at the bottom left (make sure it doesn't overlay your plots).
