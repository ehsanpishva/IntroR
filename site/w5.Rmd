In week 5, we will cover [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) as a way of writing dynamic reports and papers that are fully reproducible by including the analysis code within the document.

The Rmarkdown document for this tutorial:

- [example_rmarkdown.rmd](FIXME!)

The corresponding bibliography file:

- [references.bib](FIXME!)

Note: If you want to generate such a reference file yourself, take a look at this [link](https://www.bioinformatics.org/texmed/). It uses NCBI identifiers and converts them to the BibTeX format.
