In week 5, we will cover [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) as a way of writing dynamic reports and papers that are fully reproducible by including the analysis code within the document.

The Rmarkdown document for this tutorial:

- [example_rmarkdown.rmd](FIXME!)

The corresponding bibliography file:

- [references.bib](FIXME!)

Note: If you need to generate such a reference file yourself, take a look at this [link](https://www.bioinformatics.org/texmed/). It uses NCBI identifiers and converts them to the BibTeX format.

Instructions for exporting references from an Endnote library in the appropriate format for inclusion in an Rmarkdown document can be found [here](https://www.themillerlab.io/post/reference_management_in_rmarkdown/).
