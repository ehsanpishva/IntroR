# R for Pathway Enrichment or Drug Repositioning Analysis

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics (https://www.r-project.org/). R software provides basic program functionality, which can be added onto with smaller program modules called packages. R packages for bioinformatics allow biologists to perform a wide range of analyses from basic statistics and plotting to advanced genomic investigation. The content for the first two learning outcomes will be the same for all students. For the assignment students can choose learning on the topic pathway enrichment or drug repositioning, respectively, based on their own interest.

In this workshop, we will cover:

- a bit of history and the development of R

- how to use and interact with R

- basic data structures

- data import and export

- data inspection and manipulation

- methods for graphing data

- t-tests and analysis of (co)variance

- correlations and linear regression

- categorical data analysis and logistic regression

- add-on packages (how to find, install, and work with them)

- how/where to obtain help when you get stuck

- basic programming structures (e.g., loops, if-else statements)

- writing documents with R Markdown

- Applications of R in of pathway analysis (FN) and Drug repositioning (DN)
